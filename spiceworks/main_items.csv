I currently use them as upstream routers, VRRP, OSPF, and spanning tree.

Only other issue we had was getting some of the administrative functionality to run -- e.g. enabling SSH access.

I will submit however, that all of our switches were Dell's when I started at this company with the exception of one which was a Linksys. This switch (above) was the manager off all of them due to its beasty performance. Every time I would hookup a Linksys switch, hub, or router to my network, all sorts of strange things would happen.

,"The PowerConnect 5448 Ethernet switch delivers significant price/performance benefits. In addition to offering a secure, high-performance networking platform and delivering advanced network management features, the PowerConnect 5448 is the world’s first switch that self-optimizes for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) storage traffic. These features allow network administrators to effectively optimize and secure their network traffic. Performance The PowerConnect 5448 delivers 48 ports of wire-speed Gigabit Ethernet with advanced security and enterprise management features to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. Providing 96 Gbps for switching capacity and 71.2 Mbps forwarding rate, the PowerConnect provides ample performance for server aggregation, wiring closets and iSCSI storage. Combo ports — four ports of either small form-factor pluggable (SFP) Fiber support or 10/100/1000 Copper support — provide for connectivity flexibility and long-haul connections. iSCSI Optimization The PowerConnect 5400-series is the world’s first switch portfolio to automatically optimize itself for iSCSI storage. The switches automatically detect whether traffic flows are iSCSI-based and, if so, assigns that traffic flow a high-level quality of service. This helps ensure that iSCSI storage traffic is prioritized in the event of resource contention. The 5400-series also provides information about all active iSCSI sessions to allow for easier management and optimization. Security The PowerConnect 5448 offers multiple options and levels of security. Industry-standard features include Secure Shell (SSH)/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) management encryptions, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping, IP- and Media Access Control (MAC)-based access control lists (ACLs) access password protection, and port-based MAC address alert and lockdown. Higher level security is provided through Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) for switch management access, 802.1x authentication and Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+), and management access filtering using management access profiles. Quality of Service The PowerConnect 5448 Ethernet switch supports open industry standards, including quality of service (L3-aware), multicast support, link aggregation and dynamic virtual LAN (VLAN) configurations. Voice over IP (VoIP) Functionality Voice-VLAN functionality helps ensure VoIP traffic is prioritized in the event of resource contention. Link Layer Discovery Protocol-Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) provides detailed network topology information, emergency call service using IP phone location information and troubleshooting information. Management PowerConnect provides numerous management options, including an industry-standard command line interface (CLI), remote management using an embedded Web server and support for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based management applications.

They were very affordable compared to other PoE switches on the market (I'm looking at YOU Cisco and HP) for the same feature set. The web interface is good. The need to do initial setup via console is antiquated. A simple LED with the address of the management port should be a standard feature, even if it has to be mounted on a slide-out tray (ala the 1U DL360 series of servers from HP). Performance is good, although we did have some STP issues related to bad cable wiring by a contractor. No power strain with 12 PoE devices connected to and getting power from each switch.

The need to do initial setup via console is antiquated. A simple LED with the address of the management port should be a standard feature, even if it has to be mounted on a slide-out tray (ala the 1U DL360 series of servers from HP).

,"SonicPoint-Ni wireless access points combine IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless connectivity, management and security enforcement with deep packet inspection to extend comprehensive security flexibly across wireless networks. Features include 40 MHz channels and packet aggregation to support data rates of up to 300 Mbps, on either 2.4 GHz or 5.0 5 GHz radio channels. SonicPoint access points are capable of Wireless Intrusion Detection Services (WIDS), wireless firewalling, secure Layer 3 wireless roaming, IEE 802.11d multi-country roaming, and integrated Wireless Guest Services (WGS) to enforce password access for customers and other third-party guests. SonicPoint-Ni Dual-Band features internal antennas for discreet deployment; all SonicPoints are, wall or ceiling mountable and can be powered by ,802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) for easy deployment where electrical power is not readily available. SonicPoint-Ne models can also be powered directly through an AC adapter. SonicPoint-Ni and SonicPoint-Ne have dimmable LEDs and covers that can completely obscure logos and lights for environments that need discreet wireless coverage. With 3x3 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, SonicPoints technologyutilizes multiple antennas to enhance throughput and reliability. Enables up to eight SSIDs for dedicated authentication and privacy settings while sharing the same physical infrastructure, providing logical segmentation of both secure wireless network traffic and customer access. By including 802.11 a/b/g/n, WPA2 and WPA, organizations are able to continue utilizing older 802.11 a/b/g devices while providing 802.11n capability, thus smoothing the transition to 802.

,"SonicPoint-Ni wireless access points combine IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless connectivity, management and security enforcement with deep packet inspection to extend comprehensive security flexibly across wireless networks. Features include 40 MHz channels and packet aggregation to support data rates of up to 300 Mbps, on either 2.4 GHz or 5.0 5 GHz radio channels. SonicPoint access points are capable of Wireless Intrusion Detection Services (WIDS), wireless firewalling, secure Layer 3 wireless roaming, IEE 802.11d multi-country roaming, and integrated Wireless Guest Services (WGS) to enforce password access for customers and other third-party guests. SonicPoint-Ni Dual-Band features internal antennas for discreet deployment; all SonicPoints are, wall or ceiling mountable and can be powered by ,802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) for easy deployment where electrical power is not readily available. SonicPoint-Ne models can also be powered directly through an AC adapter. SonicPoint-Ni and SonicPoint-Ne have dimmable LEDs and covers that can completely obscure logos and lights for environments that need discreet wireless coverage. With 3x3 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, SonicPoints technologyutilizes multiple antennas to enhance throughput and reliability. Enables up to eight SSIDs for dedicated authentication and privacy settings while sharing the same physical infrastructure, providing logical segmentation of both secure wireless network traffic and customer access. By including 802.11 a/b/g/n, WPA2 and WPA, organizations are able to continue utilizing older 802.11 a/b/g devices while providing 802.11n capability, thus smoothing the transition to 802. Discrete wireless access point deployment features include light and logo covers, controllable LED (except power) and internal antennas (on SonicPoint-Ni models), ideal for hospital and medical office environments.
